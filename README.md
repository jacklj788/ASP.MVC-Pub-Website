# ASP.MVC-Pub-Website
An e-commerce website for a fake scenario of a restaurant. 
Found at: http://projectwebsitevintabebay201722018.azurewebsites.net

This website makes use of the following technolgies:
ASP.NET MVC with the Razor syntax 
C#
CSS, HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX
Google maps API
PayPal API
Twitter Widget 
GeoLocation (unsupported due to the website not being HTTPS)

The code found on this project is NOT the entire solution, but simply my MVC folders to showcase my understanding of MVC and web design.
